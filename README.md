# Sensory-Engagement-Lab-2021

The Sensory Engagement Lab researches the ways that physical computing, materiality, and interactivity contribute to embodied and sensorial experiences. It fosters collaborations between artists, technologists, and other thinkers to produce interactive and experimental art works. 
SEL meets bi-monthly and features lectures, tech workshops, and code and hardware trouble shooting sessions.
SEL was formerly based just outside DC and supported by Red Dirt in Mt. Rainer, Maryland and VisArts in Rockville, Maryland. This iteration is housed at Yes We Cannibal in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
